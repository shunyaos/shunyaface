# Shunyaface Library

> Shunyaface is a face Detection/Recognition Library which simplifies face recognition/detection on devices which support Shunya OS. 
It is written in C++.
This library was created after studying the best features of MTCNN,Dlib,Opencv .
Some layers of MTCNN were replaced with new techniques to get faster results .
To make it faster ,it uses a custom OS -Shunya which is optimised for AI libraries .

## General info

The project aims to achieve fastest detection and recognition speed with low power hardware. 
Shunyaface is written for embedded-devices like RPI-4,RPI-3,Hikey970,etc and uses Shunyaos.
Currently the library **achieves a detection FPS of 16-17 FPS on the RaspberryPi-4**. 
This Library is a trial edition and will support detection/recognition upto 100 faces.
