> Shunyaface is a face Detection/Recognition Library which simplifies face detection/recognition on devices which support Shunya OS. 

It is written in C++. This library was created after studying the best features of **MTCNN,Dlib,Opencv**.

Some layers of MTCNN were replaced with new techniques to get faster results. To make it faster ,it uses a **custom OS -Shunya** which is optimised for AI libraries .
